# SPACEMAN

Spaceman is a game similar to hangman where the player is prompted to guess a 4 - 6 letter word. All words are space-themed. Player is given 6 tries and if successful an alien abduction is prevented. If the player exceeds 6 turns and fail to guess the word then the stickman gets beamed into the spaceship.

## Technologies Used
HTML and CSS were used to create the display of the game. Javascript was used to create the logic and functionality of the game. Display messages and picture rendering were done through DOM manipulation.

## Getting Started

Use the input field at the bottom of the screen to enter your letter guess. Any incorrect guess will be displayed on the right side. To reset the game click 'Play Again'.

## Next Steps
Future enhancements include a display of letter buttons allowing user to click and see which letters were used. Enhancments such as animations of stickman being slowly beamed into spaceship would also be included.
